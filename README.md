**Nextion to Ethernet** 

Here is a board that connects a Nextion display to the ethernet, usually you need a serial device. With the board it is possible to use an Ethernet participant as a terminal device. The board acts as a getway.

* 3V to 5V IC for level conversion
* Jumper for Nextion display programming
* 5V circuit board connector, protected against polarity reversal
* W5100 or W5500 EVB WiznetBoard as Ethernet connection
* Appliaktion run Micropython

A Nextion display with 3.2 inches was used here.
